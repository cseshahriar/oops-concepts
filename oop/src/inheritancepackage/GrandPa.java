/**
 * Types of Inheritance:
 * 
 * Single Inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where a class extends the another class.
 * 
 * Multiple Inheritance: refers to the concept of one class extending more than one classes, which means 
 * a child class has two parent classes. Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance.
 * 
 * Multilevel inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where 
 * a class extends the child class. For example class A extends class B and class B extends class C.
 * 
 * Hierarchical inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship 
 * where more than one classes extends the same class. 
 * For example, class B extends class A and class C extends class A.
